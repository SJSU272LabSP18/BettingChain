Project Abstract 3


Project title: Generating and Suggesting Itineraries for people on vacations

Problem: There are many itineraries generating algorithms but few can actually include practicality in its suggestions with respect to current weather conditions and local delights.

Solution: Inspired by the paper presented on ‘Orienteering Algorithms for Generating Travel Itineraries’ (https://research.google.com/pubs/pub46479.html) this project aims at suggesting itineraries based on an efficient algorithm using Foursquare public check-in data. The idea is to create suggestions based on carefully curated data for the Bay Area and relating it to the current predicted weather conditions for a given day to give pragmatic results.  

Tools, methodology and resources 
Front-end:	AngularJS	 
Framework:	Node.js	 
Database:	DB SQL/NoSQL, IBM Cloud 
Analysis:	Python/R language
